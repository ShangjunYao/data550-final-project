## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the **Maternal Health Risk** dataset, which was collected from rural areas of Bangladesh in hospitals and clinics. The dataset comprises 1013 instances and 6 features, including Age, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar levels, Body Temperature, and Heart Rate. The target variable is the **Risk Level**, categorized as "low risk," "mid risk," or "high risk."

```{r library, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(here)
data <- read_csv(here("data", "Maternal_Health_Risk_Data_Set.csv"))
```



## Table2: Average Physiological Features by Risk Level
```{r table, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

risk_level_summary <- readRDS(here("output", "risk_level_summary.rds"))
knitr::kable(risk_level_summary, caption = "Average Physiological Features by Risk Level")
```
The table shows the mean values of each physiological feature (Age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, BS, BodyTemp, HeartRate) categorized by the risk levels: low risk, mid risk, and high risk. This table helps us understand the typical values for each physiological feature associated with different risk categories, providing insights into how these factors vary between groups.


## Table3: The distribution of Age by Risk Level
```{r boxplot, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

heart_rate_distribution <- readRDS(here("output", "heart_rate_distribution.rds"))
knitr::kable(heart_rate_distribution, caption = "Heart Rate Distribution by Risk Level")

```
The "Distribution of Age by Risk Level" boxplot displays the distribution of ages for each risk level category. From the figure, we can observe the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers in the age variable for each risk group. This visualization helps highlight whether age has a significant impact on the classification of maternal health risks, with the spread of values indicating the range of ages represented within each risk category.


## Figure1: Distribution of Heart Rate by Risk Level
```{r table3, include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "age_boxplot.png"))
```

The table titled "Distribution of Heart Rate by Risk Level" provides a detailed summary of heart rate values across different risk levels: low risk, mid risk, and high risk. It shows the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum heart rate for each category. This breakdown allows us to observe how heart rate distribution varies among risk levels, indicating potential physiological differences related to maternal health risks.

```{r boxplot2, include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "heart_rate_boxplot.png"))

```
Description of the Figure:
The "Boxplot of Heart Rate Distribution by Risk Level" shows the distribution of heart rate values for three risk levels: high risk, low risk, and mid risk.
High Risk: Median heart rate is 76 bpm with an interquartile range (IQR) from 70 to 84 bpm.
Low Risk: Median heart rate is 64 bpm with an IQR from 60 to 70 bpm. One outlier is observed below 50 bpm.
Mid Risk: Median heart rate is 75 bpm with an IQR from 70 to 80 bpm.
The low risk group shows a lower median heart rate compared to the other two risk levels, indicating potential differences in physiological characteristics.
